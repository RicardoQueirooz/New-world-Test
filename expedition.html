  <h3>Expeditions</h3>
  <p>Expeditions are five-player instanced dungeons that will take players to the darkest corners of Aeternum.</p>
  <p>There, your party will face dire threats, learn more about the source of Corruption, expose the Angry Earth's ulterior motives, reveal the deeper menace behind the Lost, and delve into the secrets of the ancient Guardians.</p>
  <p>Players can expect challenging battles which require skill and team coordination to complete.</p>
  <p>Expeditions require a group of three to five players for completion.</p>
  <p>At least one player must have the required Tuning Orb to enter.</p>
